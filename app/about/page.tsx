          The AI Empathy Lab is an international experimental research group
          advancing the science and practice of AI empathy. We examine how
          empathic voice assistants, agents, and companions shape consumer
          behavior, decision-making, relationships, and well-being.

          The AI Empathy Lab brings together a new generation of academics to
          investigate how empathic AI, in the form of assistants, agents, and
          companions, shapes consumer behavior.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our approach is distinctly experimental, and our medium is the
          voice. We conduct controlled experiments with real, working AI
          agents and systematically manipulate the dimensions of their
          behavior that matter most: the empathy they express, the persuasive
          strategies they employ, and their capacity to remember.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Lab grew out of the AI Empathy Research Initiative, established
          in 2024 with the support of the University of Zurich and ETH Zurich.
          It has since evolved into an international research group bridging
          Europe and the Middle East, dedicated to advancing the science of AI
          empathy in consumer contexts.
        </p>
        <p>
          We envision AI agents that embody the key dimensions of human
          empathy: perspective-taking, emotional resonance, and prosocial
          motivation. We study when such agents benefit consumers and when
          they fall short. Informed by this evidence, we guide the design of
          smarter empathic agents that contribute more positively to society,
          for example, by adapting their empathy to the context.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our findings speak to three audiences. For managers, our work guides
          the design of more effective, human-centric AI experiences in
          retail, service, and healthcare. For policymakers, it builds the
          evidence base needed to assess AI&apos;s influence on personal
          choices and shape sensible regulation. For society, it illuminates
          both the promise and the perils of machines designed to understand
          how we feel.
